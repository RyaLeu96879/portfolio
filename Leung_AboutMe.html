  <p>Here's a short introduction of me which you would find very useful because Iâ€™ll be a very good student when you finish reading this page. 
   My name's Ryan Leung, I'm currently a freshmen in Dublin High School in Dublin, CA.  When I complete a 4 year high school program, I have no idea right now
   of what I want to study but I'll figure out what I would like to study and major in and what I like to do as I go through high school.  As in right now,
   I would like to study something about engineering like architect or biotechnology, I would often think about other jobs that I'm potentially wanted to do 
   everytime an interesting job is brought into my life by a teacher, a guest speaker, or my family.
   <br>As of my skills when it comes to architect would be communication, which would be very useful when it comes to being an architect (communicate with 
   others to make sure the build is good, having a better communication with the workers so that they would know what to do).  Aid, which is also very 
   helpful (helping the other architects that needs help in order to build a staple building, helping workers to make sure they are doing it right).  Guide 
   which would be helpful to the workers who would be helping me build the buildings I designed (guiding them of how to build the building). 
   I got A in every subject except spanish and CSp which is a B as of now but I'm working to improve the grade on those subjects.</br>
