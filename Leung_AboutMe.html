            useful because you'll find that I'm a very good student when you finish reading this page. 
            My name's Ryan Leung, I'm currently a freshmen in Dublin High School in Dublin, CA.  
            I'm currently taking CSP(Computer Science Principles) as my elective 
            in high school which is teaching me how to code and that really teach me a lot about 
            coding and I made this website from my knowledge of CSP. I did 5 
            projects so far for the class and you can check some of it out at the project page!
            <br></br>
            When I complete a 4 year high school program, I would like to be a pilot
            as of right now, I would like to study aerospace engineering in college
            even though I want to be a commericial pilot, I would often think about 
            other jobs that I'm potentially wanted to do more than pilot
            everytime an interesting job is brought into my life by a 
            teacher, a guest speaker, or my family.
            <br></br>
            I'm a student in Dublin High school which is in Dublin, CA, I'm taking CSP right
            now and I'm learining about coding and I had done two projects so far.
            I'm curently facing the peoblem of what I want to do in the future but I'll be 
            figuring out what I would like to do really soon because with all the 
            resources I can use here in DHS and on the internet, I would be figuring it out real soon. </p></font>
